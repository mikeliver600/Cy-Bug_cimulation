# Cy-Bug_cimulation

Initializing CyBug:
The simulation starts by creating an initial CyBug instance at position (0, 0) on the game scene. The CyBug is represented by a GameObject in Unity, and it has various components attached to it, such as a SpriteRenderer for the visual appearance and an Animator for animations.

Movement of CyBug:
The CyBug is programmed to move randomly in the game world. It selects a random direction (dx and dy) from (-1, -1) to (1, 1) and updates its position (x and y) accordingly. The behavior modifier may also slightly modify this movement direction based on the consumed code.

Replication:
Periodically, the CyBug checks if it should replicate. There is a 10% chance that it will replicate in each iteration. When it replicates, a new CyBug is created as a clone of the parent CyBug. The new CyBug inherits its parent's position, sprite, and any consumed scripts.

Consuming Code:
The CyBug continuously looks for nearby objects with scripts attached to them. When it finds a script that it hasn't consumed before, it adopts the script's code to modify its behavior. This is done by implementing the ICodeConsumer interface, which allows the consumed script to interact with and modify the CyBug's behavior directly.

Behavior Modification:
The custom behavior modifier class, BehaviorModifier, is responsible for modifying the CyBug's behavior based on the consumed scripts. Currently, the modifier scales the movement of the CyBug based on the number of consumed scripts. You can implement additional methods in BehaviorModifier to modify other aspects of the CyBug's behavior.

Genetic Algorithm Integration (High-Level Overview):
Although the code provided doesn't include a full genetic algorithm implementation, you can integrate it into this simulation. In the genetic algorithm, you would have a population of CyBugs representing different genetic traits. You'd evaluate their fitness using a fitness function (e.g., how well they perform their task). Then, you'd select the fittest CyBugs, apply crossover to mix their traits, and introduce mutation to create new offspring with variations. Over several generations, the CyBugs' behavior would evolve to improve their performance based on the fitness evaluation.
